Yes, a real NES game that will run on your NES.

It's a little project to mess around with the assembly 6502.

The game is finished now, I will be updating it for a while in case any critical issues are found.

### Music
The boss encounter theme is written by Xalins.
The covers are made by me and my dad assisting with picking up notes.

The following songs were used for the covers:
- "No milk today" by Herman's Hermits (based on [these piano notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP-SnrodZT8))
- "No love" by Death Grips
- "Song Two" by I Hate Myself
- "OH! I`M TIRED!" by Portwave
- "Jesus Is a Friend of Mine" by Sonseed (having a ["Satan is a friend of mine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx7QVnHF7EY) parody version in mind)

### Special thanks
- To Harez Lair for proofreading my texts
- To Alan Fox for making a math expression for the ghosts' house
- To yizachok for suggesting several song improvements
- To all my friends and family for being enormously supportive and patient with me

### Compiling a NES build
NESASM3 is used for compiling the game via Windows.
If needed to compile, put the NESASM3 executable into the source files folder and run:
```
NESASM3 main.asm
```

The project is distributed under the teabag license. Feel free to reuse the code for your needs, but if it becomes handy to you for whatever reason and you somehow meet me in real life, make sure to buy me a cup of tea ~~or sit on my face if you are cute~~.

The basic code for the game to launch properly and the sound engine are taken from Nerdy Nights NES ASM programming tutorials.
