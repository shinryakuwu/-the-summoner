Yes, a real NES game that will run on your NES.

It's a little project to mess around with the assembly 6502.

The game is finished now, I will be updating it for a while in case any critical issues are found.

The project is distributed under the teabag license. Feel free to reuse the code for your needs, but if it becomes handy to you for whatever reason and you somehow meet me in real life, make sure to buy me a cup of tea ~~or sit on my face if you are cute~~.

The basic code for the game to launch properly and the sound engine are taken from Nerdy Nights NES ASM programming tutorials.
